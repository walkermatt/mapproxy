<!--

MapProxy is governed by a [Project Steering Committee (PSC)][1].
The PSC makes decisions on all aspects of the MapProxy project - both technical and non-technical.
Most decisions require a vote by the PSC on the [mapproxy-dev mailing list][2].

Please contact the [mapproxy-dev list][2] with a Request For Change (RFC) proposal if your pull request matches any item below:

- Changes to project infrastructure (e.g. tool, location or substantive configuration)
- Anything that could cause backward compatibility issues.
- Adding substantial amounts of new code.
- Changing inter-subsystem APIs, or objects.
- Anything that might be controversial.

You can read more about the voting process in the [PSC Guidelines][2].
